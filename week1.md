Goal
====

Topics seen:
* Git
* Github
* Basic JavaScript


Assess Students for:
* understanding basic JS principles ( object, arrays, functions)
* understanding Git & Github

How:
* true or false questions?
* fill in the blank?
* multiple choice questions?
* open questions; explain concepts?

The goal is NOT to have the students writing code (that's what the projects are for), but to test their deeper understanding of the language.
