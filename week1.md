Goal
====

Topics seen:
* Git
* Github
* Basic JavaScript


Assess Students for:
* understanding basic JS principles ( object, arrays, functions)
* understanding Git & Github

How:  - WITH CODE TO READ, NOT RUN
* true or false questions?
* fill in the blank?
* multiple choice questions?
* open questions; explain concepts?

The goal is NOT to have the students writing code (that's what the projects are for), but to test their deeper understanding of the language.


GIT:  
* how are these different - 'git checkout gh-pages', 'git checkout -b gh-pages'.  
* how is git different from github   
* rewrite 'git pull origin master' as a series of two commands  
* describe how merge conflicts arrise and how to fix them  
*   
  
js:  
1. write specifications and 3 sample input/output pairs (or before/after objects) for each code snippet below
```javascript 
	function cow(grass) {
		var poo = 0;
		var stomach = 0;
		while(stomach < 4) {
			poo += grass - (stomach * grass/4);
			stomach ++;
		};
		return poo;
	}
```
