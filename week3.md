Goal
==== 

Topics seen:
* JS algorithms
* HTML & CSS (frameworks????) & DOM manipulation
* beginner MVC architecture & data modeling
* Async 1: callbacks
* OOP JS (classes)

Assess students for:
* simple DOM manipulation
* basic CSS best practices (how to center a div, ...)
* organizing code along the MVC
* callbacks

How:
* true or false questions?
* fill in the blank?
* multiple choice questions?
* open questions; explain concepts?

The goal is NOT to have the students writing code (that's what the projects are for), but to test their deeper understanding of the language.
